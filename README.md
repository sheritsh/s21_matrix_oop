## About project

This project was carried out according to the curriculum of [School 21](https://21-school.ru).  

As part of this project, I familiarized myself with the syntax and features of C++. I practiced the object-oriented programming (OOP) approach and learned about the Rule of Five, move semantics, and references. I maintained the approach of allocating all memory at once for the entire matrix from the previous project. Additionally, all functions were covered using the [Google Test Framework](https://google.github.io/googletest/).

## How to build a lib

Please open the ./src directory and execute the `make` command in the terminal to build **s21_matrix_oop.a** library.

## Matrix operations

| Operation | Description | Exceptional situations |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `bool EqMatrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Checks matrices for equality with each other |  |
| `void SumMatrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Adds the second matrix to the current one | different matrix dimensions |
| `void SubMatrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Subtracts another matrix from the current one | different matrix dimensions |
| `void MulNumber(const double num) ` | Multiplies the current matrix by a number |  |
| `void MulMatrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Multiplies the current matrix by the second matrix | the number of columns of the first matrix is not equal to the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `S21Matrix Transpose()` | Creates a new transposed matrix from the current one and returns it |  |
| `S21Matrix CalcComplements()` | Calculates the algebraic addition matrix of the current one and returns it | the matrix is not square |
| `double Determinant()` | Calculates and returns the determinant of the current matrix | the matrix is not square |
| `S21Matrix InverseMatrix()` | Calculates and returns the inverse matrix | matrix determinant is 0 |

Apart from those operations, you also need to implement constructors and destructors:

| Method | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `S21Matrix()` | A basic constructor that initialises a matrix of some predefined dimension |  
| `S21Matrix(int rows, int cols) ` | Parametrized constructor with number of rows and columns |
| `S21Matrix(const S21Matrix& other)` | Copy constructor |
| `S21Matrix(S21Matrix&& other)` | Move constructor |
| `~S21Matrix()` | Destructor |

And you also need to overload the following operators, partly corresponding to the operations above:

| Operator | Description | Exceptional situations |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `+`      | Addition of two matrices | different matrix dimensions |
| `-`   | Subtraction of one matrix from another | different matrix dimensions |
| `*`  | Matrix multiplication and matrix multiplication by a number | the number of columns of the first matrix does not equal the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `==`  | Checks for matrices equality (`EqMatrix`) | |
| `=`  | Assignment of values from one matrix to another one | |
| `+=`  | Addition assignment (`SumMatrix`) | different matrix dimensions |
| `-=`  | Difference assignment (`SubMatrix`) | different matrix dimensions |
| `*=`  | Multiplication assignment (`MulMatrix`/`MulNumber`) | the number of columns of the first matrix does not equal the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `(int i, int j)`  | Indexation by matrix elements (row, column) | index is outside the matrix |

## Technical specifications

- The program must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard using gcc compiler
- The program code must be located in the src folder
- When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style
- Implement the matrix as an `S21Matrix` class
- Use only the `matrix_`, `rows_` and `cols_` fields as private.
- Implement the access to private fields `rows_` and `cols_` via accessor and mutator. If the matrix increases in size, it is filled with zeros. If it decreases in size, the excess is simply discarded.
- Make it as a static library (with s21_matrix_oop.h header file)
- Implement the operations described [above](#matrix-operations)
- Overload the operators according to the table in the chapter [above](#matrix-operations)
- Prepare full coverage of library functions code with unit-tests using the GTest library
- Provide a Makefile for building the library and tests (with targets all, clean, test, s21_matrix_oop.a)

## Test results

Using the Google Test Framework, all functions, including error handling, were covered with tests. This ensures comprehensive test coverage for the code and guarantees proper program behavior, including correct error handling. Excellent work in adopting such an approach!
